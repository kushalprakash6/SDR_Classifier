### Current observation (KP)

https://nupic.docs.numenta.org/stable/api/algorithms/classifiers.html#module-nupic.algorithms.sdr_classifier

nupic referred in the project ideas link is in python language. May be we have to port it over to C# language.

So we need to check if we have to fork it, or create an own branch

We also need to check on how to collaborate and where to keep the project.
